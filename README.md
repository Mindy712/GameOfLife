# Conway's Game Of Life
This visualization shows the step by step evolution of the cells according to the following rules:

1. Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if by underpopulation
2. Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation
3. Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overpopulation
4. Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction

## How To Play
To start, simply tap on the cells to make them "live", and hit the Advance button to see the next generation.
